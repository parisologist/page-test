- [Bash Scripting Notes](docs/bash.html)
- [Xpath Tricks](docs/xpath.html)
- [Escape from Freedom, by Erich Fromm](docs/escapeFromFreedom.html) explores how individuals, despite gaining political and economic freedom, often feel isolated and anxious, leading them to seek security through authoritarianism, conformity, or destructive tendencies.
- [The Ethics of Ambiguity, by Simone De Beauvoir](docs/ethicsOfAmbiguity.html) argues that human freedom is inherently ambiguous, and ethical living requires embracing this ambiguity by actively choosing and affirming freedom for oneself and others.
